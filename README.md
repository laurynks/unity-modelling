# UNITY Network Modeling Repository

Welcome to the **UNITY Network Modeling Repository** 👋  

This repository is part of the [UNITY Network](https://www.unity-mri.com/), a global initiative to improve child health through the use of **ultra-low-field MRI** and other accessible neuroimaging tools. Here, researchers and developers collaborate to share, test, and improve **code for modeling data** across diverse populations and contexts.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

The UNITY Network spans many research sites worldwide, working together to ensure that advances in neuroimaging are **globally inclusive** and **locally relevant**.  

This repository provides a **shared workspace** where contributors can:  
- Upload and maintain code for data modeling cognitive outcomes.  
- Share best practices and examples for reproducible research.  
- Collaborate on common tools and pipelines, reducing duplication of effort across sites.
